I'm a PhD student in applied mathematics at the [CEREMADE](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr) laboratory attached to the University Paris Dauphine--PSL. My research touches functional inequalities, PDE, and spectral theory. The PhD is supervised by [Jean Dolbeault](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~dolbeaul/) and [David Gontier](hhttps://cermics.enpc.fr/~gontierd/).
